      <h1>Lessons Learned on a Mountain</h1>
      <p>The first time I went backpacking, Mother Nature pummeled me with a near-lethal dose of reality. It was not arrogance, but inexperience that allowed it to happen; I didn't know how to mentally prepare for the challenge ahead. Perhaps that was for the best, as the mind has to learn quickly when thrown to the fire.</p>
      <p>Standing two thousand three hundred feet below the twelve thousand five hundred foot summit of West Maroon Pass, a pang of anxiety began to crawl down my spine. Thirty seconds into the ascent I was keeled onto my knees sucking air through lungs that felt as though they were pinched halfway shut. My anxiety was turning into a full blown panic attack, until I surrendered to the moment. I realized there was no turning back, the only direction was forward. Finding comfort in the simplicity of that thought I was able to regain control of my breath and continue hiking.</p>
      <p>People tend to refer to any form of mountaineering as “type 2” fun, because they say you enjoy the memory of the experience far more than the experience itself. Despite the initial fear I’ve described above, I have enjoyed many more backpacking trips since that day. While I am quite fond of the memories (and the photos), it is the experience that draws me back for more adventure. Each time I return with new lessons that provide new perspectives on life. This post will document the lessons learned so far, and capture those yet to be taught:</p>
