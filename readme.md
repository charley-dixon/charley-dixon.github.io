# Portfolio

Years ago I put together a portfolio using Wix. Recently I decided to commit myself to learning web development, and so I have rebuilt the entire portfolio from scratch using HTML & CSS.

I have included a blog on here to talk about the various lessons learned, and eventually this will also host links to various web application projects that I want to build.
